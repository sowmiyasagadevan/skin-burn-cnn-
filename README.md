Provisional Diagnosis and Prognosis of Burn Skin Using CNN
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of burn injuries. The model not only classifies the severity of burns but also offers treatment recommendations for effective clinical decision-making in plastic surgery.Burn injuries require precise diagnosis and prognosis for successful treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods often fall short in accuracy. Classify burn injuries into four categories: First-degree, Second-degree, Third-degree, and Healthy skin.it provide prognostic insights by predicting the healing process also offer treatment recommendations based on burn severity, assisting medical professionals.
